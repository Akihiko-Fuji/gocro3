Gocro3: Genuine OCR Optimizer 3

High Performance, High Precision PDF OCR Tool
Project Overview
This project is a powerful tool that uses Python to extract characters contained in PDF files using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert standard PDF documents into PDFs with searchable text. It is especially designed for mixed Japanese and English documents and provides a variety of preprocessing options to achieve highly accurate and efficient text recognition.


This program is available free of charge because its functionality is based on a free library. I thank the developers of the library.

# Features
Multiple OCR settings: Try different combinations of settings (PSM, OEM) in OCR processing to select the best result.
Advanced image preprocessing: Multiple preprocessing methods are implemented to improve text recognition accuracy, such as image hi-resolution, grayscaling, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction.
Japanese language support: To improve recognition accuracy of Japanese characters, an option to use a specific number of Japanese words as the evaluation criterion is provided.
User-friendly interface: Provides file selection dialogs and configuration options for intuitive and easy operation.
Exception handling and error messages: When users face errors, appropriate messages are displayed to assist in problem resolution.

# Key Features
Embedding OCR text: makes PDF searchable and improves user efficiency by embedding the extracted text into the same page of the PDF.
Flexible evaluation criteria: Evaluates extracted text from a variety of perspectives, including number of Japanese words, overall text length, and general text quality, to select the best results.
Progress status display: Displays processing progress on the console to visualize progress when handling large numbers of documents.

# Examples of use
File Selection: Select PDF files using the Tkinter dialog.
Specify output destination: Specify where to save the processed PDF file.
Select evaluation criteria: Select whether to base the evaluation on the number of Japanese words or the length of the entire text.
Perform OCR processing: Extract text using advanced image preprocessing and multiple OCR settings, and embed the best results into the PDF based on the specified evaluation criteria.

# Recommended for
Researchers: Anyone who wants to convert scanned literature into digital data and make it searchable.
Business users: Anyone who wants to efficiently manage reports and invoices in PDF format.
Translators: Anyone who handles documents in multiple languages.
This tool is a powerful solution for easily extracting text data in PDF files and converting them into searchable formats. We invite you to try this high-performance and easy-to-use OCR tool!
